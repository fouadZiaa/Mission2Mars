# Mission2Mars


## Overview
This project scrapes data from various websites to create an new webpage that highlights latest facts and news about the planet Mars. We used splinter and beautiful soup libraries to scrape the relevant data. After the data retreival, we transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to a webpage using Flask. Later bootstrap was used to cleanup the page.
